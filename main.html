				<h1>Finding Me</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>I had a strict parent growing up in an Asian community. It was a standard to compete between parents on how smart their kids were where I was living. A famous Korean saying goes, "A child's grade reflects on the parents' grades," which makes parents often interfere with their child's education. I sometimes was physically disciplined when I got a bad mark in school or didn't solve a question correctly. Influenced by this Korean 'culture' of education, I always had a standard to be the best, highest-performing student in the school. </p>

				<p>To stand out from the crowd and achieve more from the school, I ran for the student vice-president for my elementary school in Korea. My usual task was to lead a conference with the class president of each senior class, who came together every Thursday to debate the school's current system issues. We would talk about improving facilities such as the bathroom, gym, cafeteria, and school fairs. Every Monday, I was asked to present what other class presidents and I talked about during the meeting. I was always the leader of every group, working together to enhance the students' time in school. I have lived a rigorous and well-organized life but did not have time off to work on my interests. I had focused more on schoolwork or my high grades than having a fun time enjoying what I love to do. Achieving superior grades by sacrificing my hobbies had led to my expectancy being high, getting all - or close to - a perfect score on every subject. </p>

				<h1>Canada</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>It was a little over halfway through our school year when our family decided to move to Canada. My parents advised me that there would be a much better educational opportunity in Canada - which was ironic as I have experienced the Canadian educational system before. Most universities in Canada offered substantially better education as well as career opportunities compared to universities in Korea, although being easier to get into. The high school system in Canada was significantly more effortless than my education in Korea and was less strict. Schools in Canada were enjoyable and allowed me to take time off to focus on subjects that I liked other than completing homework every evening. I could develop my interests in programming, reading books, and building computers, which eventually made me obsessed with computer science. Although I didn't study as much as I did back in Korea, my grades started rising, as I relaxed that no one would care if I did poorly.</p>

				<h2>How?</h2>
				<p>Lung cancer shares all the properties of any other cancers, which are mainly caused by mutation of DNA of a cell. These mutations are occured in a both extrinsic and intrinsic ways. Extrinsic means that source from outside of the body alters with the genomic sequence, and intrinsic is where factors such as genetics causes a replication error.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Extrinsic</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Extrinsic factors consist of X-rays, UV lights, chemicals (benzene), and radioactive elements (Radon). The damages done by external factors could be fixed by a repair mechanism of a DNA. However, if the repair doesn’t happen, apoptosis, or programmed death of a cell, occurs. Sometimes the apoptosis also doesn’t work, creating enough mutation to create a cancer cell. The process repeats and duplicates to form a tumour on a body.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Intrinsic</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Intrinsic factors are replication error of genes inherited from a family member. A certain change in DNA (alternations in chromosome 6) could change the possibility of a person getting lung cancer. Also, certain people inherit a better ability to break down cancer-causing chemicals from a cigarette. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Symptoms</h2>
				<p>On top of cell-specific symptoms mentioned above, there are a few more common symptoms of lung cancer, which are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hoarseness</li>
					<li>A lingering or worsening cough</li>
					<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>
					<li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li>
					<li>High blood pressure</li>
					<li>Coughing up phlegm (mucus) or blood</li>
					<li>Vomiting</li>
					<li>Muscle weakness</li>
					<li>Coma</li>

				<h1>Diagnosis & Treatments</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
				<p>Lung cancer are usually diagnosed by taking tests. These are the possible ways to diagnose cancer of an patient: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>CT scans</strong> scan the patient's body, creating a visual of the inside. Dye may be injected into the patients' body to get a clearer view of the veins and the organs.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Physical exams</strong> are tests that checks general health of a patient. During the physical exam, the doctor will check for any possible disease that might by in the patient's body.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Sputum cytology</strong> is where a pathologist checks sputum from a patient and views it through a microscope, looking for possible cancer cells. </li> <br>
					<li><strong>Labratory tests</strong> are procedures where the doctor looks through a sample of patient's urine, blood, or tissues to diagnose a disease.</li>
				</ul> <hr>
				<h2>Treatments</h2>
				<p>Although the best treatment for lung cancer would be to prevent it - not smoking, there are still treatments for lung cancers. Possible treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy (cdc.gov). If a person has Small cell lung cancer, the doctors will run tests to find if the patient has genetic mutation due to the cancer cells, and treat them accordingly. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Surgery</strong> is where the operator physically cuts out the cancer cells or tissue that had been damaged. </li> <br>
					<li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> means getting rid of the cancer cells using chemicals and drugs,which can be in the form of pills or injection.</li> <br>
					<li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> uses x-rays and high-energy rays to kill the cancer (cdc.gov).</li> <br>
					<li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong> is similar to chemotherapy, but instead of killing the cancer cells with drugs, targeted therapy is used to stop the spread of cancer cells with drugs. </li>
				</ul>
