				<h1>Finding Me</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>I had a strict parent growing up in an Asian community. It was a standard to compete between parents on how smart their kids were where I was living. A famous Korean saying goes, "A child's grade reflects on the parents' grades," which makes parents often interfere with their child's education. I sometimes was physically disciplined when I got a bad mark in school or didn't solve a question correctly. Influenced by this Korean 'culture' of education, I always had a standard to be the best, highest-performing student in the school. </p>

				<p>To stand out from the crowd and achieve more from the school, I ran for the student vice-president for my elementary school in Korea.I was always the leader of every group, working together to enhance the students' time in school. I have lived a rigorous and well-organized life but did not have time off to work on my interests and had focused more on schoolwork or my high grades than having a fun time enjoying what I love to do. Achieving superior grades by sacrificing my hobbies had led to my expectancy being high, getting all - or close to - a perfect score on every subject. </p>
				<p>It was a little over halfway through our school year when our family decided to move to Canada. My parents advised me that there would be a much better educational opportunity as most universities in Canada offered substantially better education and career opportunities compared to universities in Korea, although being easier to get into. The high school system in Canada allowed me to take time off to focus on subjects that I liked other than completing homework every evening. Although I didn't study as much as I did back in Korea, my grades started rising, as I relaxed that no one would care if I did poorly.</p>

				<h1>Programming</h1>

				<p>I love programming. My passion for computers and programming had started when my brother suggested I build a computer with him. Although the computer we built didn't have the best components, we were pleased enough that we were able to successfully build a computer for the first time. While my brother was more interested in the physical (hardware) side of the computer, managing, downloading, and developing software was more appealing to me. The nature of coding had always fascinated me, and gradually made me look into careers in the field of computer science. </p>

				<p>With fundamentals of programming learned from courses in school, I decided to start a project that I'd work on during the summer to further develop my understanding of programming. I have bought several online courses and Google's UX certificate course and started plotting for my big project. Influenced by other community members, a group of people who are all learning how to program, I decided to build a portfolio website after hearing how important they were. I have seen the potential of a well-built portfolio and thought to catch both rabbits - University applications and future careers. I wanted a single webpage (which can be viewed <a href="https://jiwonportfolio.netlify.app/">here</a>) to describe who I am, from my skills to my previous projects that I have created. </p>
