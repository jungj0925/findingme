				<h1>Finding Me</h1>

				<p>
					I had a strict parent growing up in an Asian community. It was a standard to compete between parents on how smart their kids were where I was living. A famous Korean saying goes, "A child's grade reflects on the parents' grades," which makes parents often interfere with their child's education. I sometimes was physically disciplined when I got a bad mark in school or didn't solve a question correctly. <br><br>Influenced by this Korean 'culture' of education, I always had a standard to be the best, highest-performing student in the school. Always being the leader of every group, I worked as a student vice-president for my elementary school in Korea. I have lived a rigorous and well-organized life but did not have time off to work on my interests and had focused more on schoolwork or my high grades than having a fun time enjoying what I love to do.

				<p>Halfway through the school year, our family decided to move to Canada, as we saw a much better educational opportunity. Most universities in Canada offer substantially better education and career opportunities than universities in Korea, although being easier to be admitted to. The high school system in Canada allowed me to take time off to focus on subjects that I liked other than completing homework every evening. Although I didn't study as much as I did back in Korea, my grades started rising, as I relaxed that no one would care if I did poorly.</p>

				<h1>Programming</h1>

				<p>I have built this website to show how I follow my bliss, which personally represents engineering, mathematics, and coding. I was always fascinated by numbers' nature and capabilities and was the type of kid that memorized the digits of Pi just for the fun of it. <br><br> My passion for mathematics started when my mom introduced math when I was five years old. I began to enjoy mathematics when I participated in a Mathematics Evaluation held by Haebub, a prominent education company in Korea. Since then, I have competed in various mathematics contests with my curiosity in math, both in Korea and Canada. Seeing how a complex question can be solved efficiently using math was fascinating.</p>

					My interest in math led to my fascination for computers and programming, which started when my brother suggested I build a computer with him. Coming from a family where we think curiosity is a significant value, my brother and I have had many unusual topics he and I would experiment with. I immediately agreed that I was a grade 8 and obsessed with video games. With some financial help from our parents, we could build our very own computer. Although it didn't have the best components, we were pleased that we were able to build a computer without any background knowledge in engineering. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Allured by the potential of mathematics and computers, I decided to blend the two of my interests and carry on my passion for pursuing my future career in computer science. With fundamentals of programming learned from courses in school, I decided to start a project that I'd work on during the summer to further develop my understanding of programming. I have bought several online courses, such as Google's UX certificate course and started plotting for my big project. I decided to build a portfolio website after hearing how important they were. I have seen the potential of a well-built portfolio and thought to catch both rabbits - University applications and future careers. I wanted a single webpage to describe who I am, from my skills to the previous projects that I have created. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It was not an easy process. I regularly spent nights solving a single problem, and from someone relatively new to programming, there have been numerous issues with my webpage. The most significant issue was compatibility between devices such as phones, PCs, tablets, and even programs such as Chrome or Edge. As learned from Google's UX design course, compatibility and accessibility were crucial design aspects. Many 'explanations' posted on the internet did not give me a concrete answer along with the multiple errors. However, by searching through helpful resources and asking other community members, I could resolve many of my mistakes in design and compatibility.

					I have finally completed the project in three months, using plugins, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website felt smooth, finished, and well-designed. I was proud of how well the website turned out (which can be viewed <a href="https://jiwonportfolio.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>). The experience of planning, organizing and executing a big project was influential to my future success as I could develop my interests. The most important part for programming for me is that I truly enjoy planning, organizing, and actually coding personal projects, and although it sometimes might get frustrating, programming entertains me.
