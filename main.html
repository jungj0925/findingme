				<h1>Finding Me</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>II had a strict parent growing up in an Asian community. It was a standard to compete between parents on how smart their kids were where I was living. A famous Korean saying goes, "A child's grade reflects on the parents' grades," which makes parents often interfere with their child's education. I sometimes was physically disciplined when I got a bad mark in school or didn't solve a question correctly. Influenced by this Korean 'culture' of education, I always had a standard to be the best, highest-performing student in the school. Always being the leader of every group, I worked as a student vice-president for my elementary school in Korea. I have lived a rigorous and well-organized life but did not have time off to work on my interests and had focused more on schoolwork or my high grades than having a fun time enjoying what I love to do. </p>

				<p>It was a little over halfway through our school year when our family decided to move to Canada. My parents advised me that there would be a much better educational opportunity as most universities in Canada offered substantially better education and career opportunities compared to universities in Korea, although being easier to get into. The high school system in Canada allowed me to take time off to focus on subjects that I liked other than completing homework every evening. Although I didn't study as much as I did back in Korea, my grades started rising, as I relaxed that no one would care if I did poorly.</p>

				<h1>Programming</h1>

				<p>I love programming. My passion for computers and programming had started when my brother suggested I build a computer with him. Although the computer we built didn't have the best components, we were pleased enough that we were able to successfully build a computer for the first time. While my brother was more interested in the physical (hardware) side of the computer, managing, downloading, and developing software was more appealing to me. The nature of coding had always fascinated me, and gradually made me look into careers in the field of computer science. </p>

				<p>With fundamentals of programming learned from courses in school, I decided to start a project that I'd work on during the summer to further develop my understanding of programming. By taking online courses and gradually getting more and more comfortable with coding, I realized that this was what I truly wanted to do. Trying to solve errors and bugs was extremely difficult at the time, but the emotions I got when I resolved the issue was more than enough to make me passionate about what I was doing. To really see my potential, I have decided to create my own personal website that represents who I am, without copying what other people had already done (website can be viewed <a href="https://jiwonportfolio.netlify.app/">here</a>).
